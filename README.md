# Introduction
A problem solver at heart who loves engineering solutions to complex business problems. I have been working for more than 6 years in diverse companies, from startups to scale-ups, building solutions ranging from ML and IoT to content management systems and cloud migrations. Most of my experience has been with the JavaScript technology stack, focusing on backend tools like Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and AWS. However, I also have some familiarity with and a willingness to work with other technologies, particularly Golang, Python, and GCP.
