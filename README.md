# Introduction
Curiosity and challenge are what drive me as a software engineer. I enjoy engineering solutions to complex problems and developing applications that are used by real customers. The engineering complexities motivate me to learn more and improve. Over the past six years, I have worked in startups, scale-ups, and corporates, tackling a diverse range of solutions from ML and IoT to content management systems and cloud migrations. I am a problem solver at heart who enjoys working with technology to address engineering challenges. My tech stack has primarily included JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, AWS, Python, and Azure, but I am always open to exploring new tools and technologies as needed.
