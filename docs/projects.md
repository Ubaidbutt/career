## Introduction
During my career, I have had the opportunity to work on several interesting projects. This document highlights the context, challenges, and key learnings from those experiences.

## Predictive Maintenance for industrial machinery @AlphaBOLD
This project is special because it was my first project straight out of university. It started as an MVP when our company collaborated with university students who were designing hardware for IoT devices to measure various telemetry data from industrial machinery. The idea was to **generate telemetry data such as pressure, temperature, vibration, voltage**, etc., and build a **simple analysis tool to display charts and graphs**, helping the technical team monitor the operation of the equipment.

The first phase involved designing a data ingestion solution using Microsoft Azure to ingest real-time telemetry data and develop visualizations. I recall working with various **Microsoft services, such as Azure IoT Hub and Azure Event Hub**, to ingest data from IoT devices and using **SaaS solutions like Azure IoT Central** for data visualization. 

I have fond memories of traveling far from the city to a large factory and working closely with the hardware and technical teams on-site to test data ingestion and workflows. I also began working with the **MERN stack to build a simple web application** that supported advanced visualizations and features for the technical team to view telemetry data.

The next phase was even more exciting as we began storing data and experimenting with machine learning models to develop an anomaly detection solution capable of predicting when something might go wrong with a machine. I used **Python and Azure ML Studio to experiment, deploy ML models**, and integrate them into our web solution. This enabled a basic level of alerting for the team whenever unusual patterns appeared in the data.

Although this project was just an MVP, it was a pivotal experience that helped me transition into professional life and understand the dynamics of building solutions for real customers. I gained valuable insights into scalability as we handled six IoT devices, each sending hundreds of messages per second—my first exposure to working at such a scale. Alongside my engineering manager, I had the opportunity to present this MVP to numerous potential customers, write blogs, and organize webinars. This experience provided immense learning, not only on the technical front but also in **marketing and sales, giving me a well-rounded perspective on bringing a product to market**.

## SaaS solution for alcohol measuring IoT solution @AlphaBOLD
The last MVP project led us to collaborate with a client who had a state-of-the-art touch-based **alcohol measuring device and needed to develop a SaaS solution** to offer to their customers. The concept was straightforward: the company would sell the devices to various corporations, each of which would have a dedicated portal to register their employees and devices. Through this portal, corporations could monitor employees' alcohol levels daily before shifts, manage the entire process, receive business alerts, and access a range of additional features.

We chose the **MERN technology stack along with Microsoft Azure** to develop this platform because it was widely used and I was already comfortable with it. I initially started building the project alone, collaborating closely with my engineering manager. Later, we hired a couple of engineers for frontend and full-stack development. This project pushed me out of my comfort zone, as it was the first time I worked with a client preparing to launch their product. The timelines were strict, and the stakes were high—not just for our company, but also for the client, who was starting their business.

The first six months were challenging as we set up everything from **databases to infrastructure, backend APIs, and the frontend**, ultimately delivering the first version with a basic admin portal featuring user and device management. The initial version turned out well, and after a few revisions, the client was satisfied. However, the real challenge began with the integration layer between our backend and the IoT devices. Reaching an agreement on protocols, topics, message payloads, and testing the integration was a significant hurdle, especially while coordinating with a 12-hour time difference. 

In the first year, we expanded to a team of four, **set up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, automated the infrastructure with Terraform**, and delivered a stable version of the product. This enabled the client to onboard their first customer onto the portal, managing six IoT devices. We were processing 200,000 messages from the devices, which included health checks, alcohol measurements, and employee registrations. The platform allowed customers to configure alert metrics, integrate mobile and email notifications, and access basic analytics from the measurements.

The most significant feature we delivered in this project was **over-the-air (OTA) updates for the IoT devices**. The customer faced challenges in manually updating the firmware of devices, particularly those deployed to end-users. They requested a feature that would allow the admin to upload firmware, manage devices, and initiate the update process for selected devices to fetch and install the firmware remotely. This was a complex task, as we had to design a highly secure communication mechanism, and testing the solution posed its own challenges. Despite these hurdles, we successfully delivered the feature under a tight deadline and deployed it to production with no major issues.

This project has been instrumental in shaping my journey as a software engineer. It provided invaluable learning experiences, from independently tackling complex problems and finding solutions to communicating with clients, negotiating features and timelines, assisting with hiring, and taking the lead on the project. What made it most fulfilling was successfully helping a startup launch their product, onboarding **eight customers with over 3,000 employees and 21 IoT devices, collectively handling 500,000 messages per day**. Accomplishing this while I was still fresh out of university and in the early years of my career made it an especially rewarding experience.
