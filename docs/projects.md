During my career, I have had the opportunity to work on several interesting projects. This document highlights the context, challenges, and key learnings from those experiences.

## Predictive Maintenance for industrial machinery @AlphaBOLD
This project is special because it was my first project straight out of university. It started as an MVP when our company collaborated with university students who were designing hardware for IoT devices to measure various telemetry data from industrial machinery. The idea was to **generate telemetry data such as pressure, temperature, vibration, voltage**, etc., and build a **simple analysis tool to display charts and graphs**, helping the technical team monitor the operation of the equipment.

The first phase involved designing a data ingestion solution using Microsoft Azure to ingest real-time telemetry data and develop visualizations. I recall working with various **Microsoft services, such as Azure IoT Hub and Azure Event Hub**, to ingest data from IoT devices and using **SaaS solutions like Azure IoT Central** for data visualization. 

I have fond memories of traveling far from the city to a large factory and working closely with the hardware and technical teams on-site to test data ingestion and workflows. I also began working with the **MERN stack to build a simple web application** that supported advanced visualizations and features for the technical team to view telemetry data.

The next phase was even more exciting as we began storing data and experimenting with machine learning models to develop an anomaly detection solution capable of predicting when something might go wrong with a machine. I used **Python and Azure ML Studio to experiment, deploy ML models**, and integrate them into our web solution. This enabled a basic level of alerting for the team whenever unusual patterns appeared in the data.

Although this project was just an MVP, it was a pivotal experience that helped me transition into professional life and understand the dynamics of building solutions for real customers. I gained valuable insights into scalability as we handled six IoT devices, each sending hundreds of messages per secondâ€”my first exposure to working at such a scale. Alongside my engineering manager, I had the opportunity to present this MVP to numerous potential customers, write blogs, and organize webinars. This experience provided immense learning, not only on the technical front but also in **marketing and sales, giving me a well-rounded perspective on bringing a product to market**.

## SaaS solution for alcohol measuring IoT solution @AlphaBOLD
The last MVP project led us to collaborate with a client who had a state-of-the-art touch-based alcohol measuring device and needed to develop a SaaS solution to offer to their customers. The concept was straightforward: the company would sell the devices to various corporations, each of which would have a dedicated portal to register their employees and devices. Through this portal, corporations could monitor employees' alcohol levels daily before shifts, manage the entire process, receive business alerts, and access a range of additional features.
